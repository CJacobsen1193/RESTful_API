# README: RESTful API Implementation for Customer Entity

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a RESTful API using a `Customer` entity. The API provides basic CRUD operations to manage customers and adheres to RESTful principles for seamless integration and scalability. It is designed for learning and can serve as a foundation for more complex applications.

## Features
- **Create a customer**: Add new customer records to the database.
- **Retrieve customer data**: Fetch details for a specific customer or a list of all customers.
- **Update customer records**: Modify existing customer information.
- **Delete customers**: Remove customer records from the database.
- **RESTful design**: Implements HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for resource management.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for REST API development.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for lightweight and fast development (configurable for other databases).
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies Java development by reducing boilerplate code.
